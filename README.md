## Description

This program is created to for users to share their blog articles. The program follows a MVC paradigm, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize and MySQL as the ORM, express-session and node Express for backend server requests and npm packages for the overall functionality. 

The User will be required to create an account to have access to the features. These include, creating a post, commenting on a post, Updating and deleting your posts and viewing other users comments on your post.

At the moment the UI is simple and definitely needs polishing up for a more user friendly experience, but the overall functionality is there.
